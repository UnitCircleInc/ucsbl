# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_secret_sharing

# Works with either fp.py (which is fast) or gf2.py (which is slower)

# NOTES:
#
# 1. The current implementation does not support splitting secret values
# that are larger than the field size or 0.  This can be achived by the user
# of this library by wrapping the secret with an ephemeral symmetric key
# and using a suitable symmetric AEAD encryption algorithm like
# nacl.secret.Aead.  The splitting the ephermeral key.
# [ssss](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssss) seems to take this approach.
#
# 2. This library does not test to ensure that the results of the join
# reconstruct the orginal value.  For example if incorrect or insuffient
# secret splits are provided, an output will be computed that is incorrect.
# Detection of incorrect or insufficient secret splits when joining
# can be achived by using an MAC/HMAC hashing function on the secret and then
# verifying that the reconstructed secret's MAC/HMAC matches the original's.
# Other solutions exist depending on the application.
#
# 3. If more secret splits are provided that required for quarum, the return
# value will still be the correct secret.

# Typical Usage:
#
#  # Split a secret into 5 splits with a quarum of 3
#  field = gf2.GF2([256, 10, 5, 2, 0])
#  s = field.random()
#  while s == field(0):
#     s = field.random()
#  r = split(s, 3, 5)
#
#  # Recover secret from a quarum - could be any 3 values from r
#  rs = join(r[:3])
#
#  # s == rs
